## TODO
* Alt tags
* Meta titles, description
* Art - Link if available as a print
* Art - Spicy option
* Lighthouse tests
* Add portable text type
* Query validation
* Split up Gallery->Scroll to image method into 2 methods. One for slider and one for modal content. Use each where necessary
* Find better way to get currentImage in Gallery, rather than > 100 and < 100. Maybe find closest to 0 instead
